The source code demonstrates linear regression using two approaches:

1. Closed-form solution (Normal Equation)– directly calculates the best-fit line using matrix operations.
2. Gradient Descent – iteratively updates the model parameters to minimize the mean squared error (MSE).


* Generates a synthetic dataset with random points.
* Calculates the regression line using both methods.
* Visualizes the results by plotting the data, the regression lines, and the gradient descent loss curve over iterations.
* Compares the parameter values (intercept and slope) from both methods.

This is a great introduction to understanding how linear regression works mathematically and visually.
